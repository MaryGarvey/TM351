Release of underlying data for characteristics breakdowns in SFR 01/2016: Revised GCSE and equivalent results in England: 2014 to 2015.

Background
This statistical first release (SFR) includes 2014/15 information on attainment for GCSE and equivalent results by different pupil characteristics, specifically gender, ethnicity, eligibility for free school meals (FSM), disadvantage, special educational needs (SEN) and English as a first language, at National and LA level.
The 2014/15 figures contained within this SFR use data collected for the 2015 Secondary School Performance Tables, which has been checked by schools.

CHANGES TO THE PRODUCTION OF THESE STATISTICS
Two major reforms were implemented in 2013/14 which affected the calculation of key stage 4 (KS4) performance measures data:

	1. Professor Alison Wolf’s Review of Vocational Education recommendations which; 
		•	restrict the qualifications counted
		•	prevent any qualification from counting as larger than one GCSE
		•	cap the number of non-GCSEs included in performance measures at two per pupil 

	2. An early entry policy to only count a pupil’s first attempt at a qualification.
 
The 2015 secondary school performance measures will continue to be calculated on the same basis, with the addition that the early entry policy now covers all subject areas instead of only those that count in the English Baccalaureate. 



The following quality and methodology information documents accompany this SFR:
Revised GCSE and equivalent results in England, 2014 to 2015: Quality and methodology information
This documents provides further information on the data sources, their coverage, the quality and how the data is validated and processed, as well as further information on the 2013/14 reforms and their extension in 2014/15.


Coverage
The characteristics statistics presented in this SFR cover all state-funded schools, including academies and city technology colleges.
Geographical breakdowns of figures in tables LA6 to LA10 are based on the local authority maintaining the school.
Figures in tables PR1 to PR4 are pupil residency based.
Figures in tables SL1, SL2 and PC1 are school location based.

Validation and quality assurance
Key stage 4 performance tables data is created when pupils’ key stage 4 attainment records are ‘matched’ to their corresponding school census records and prior attainment records by a matching contractor, using fields such as surname, forename, date of birth, UPN and gender. This successfully matches around 60-75% of pupils.
Additional, more complex, routines are then applied to match as many of the remaining pupils as possible, up to around 97-98%.

Statistical disclosure control
To protect confidentiality the following conventions have been used throughout this publication:

•	Low counts (numbers below 3) have been suppressed and replaced by (x).  Secondary suppression has then been applied when necessary to prevent disclosure by differencing.
•	0 is shown only when the true value is 0.
•	If a denominator is 0, the associated numerator is replaced with a dot (.) as not applicable.

* There have been classification changes relating to special educational need (SEN) and type of need in 2014/15
For 2014/15, following SEND reforms, SEN pupils are categorised as 'SEN with a statement or Education, health and care (EHC) plan' and 'SEN support'. SEN support replaces school action and school action plus but some pupils remain with these provision types in first year of transition. 
SEN support but no specialist assessment of type is a new SEN type of need for 2014/15. In addition, Behavior,emotional and social difficulty (BESD) has been removed and a new code social emotional and mental health (SEMH) has been introduced. 

SEN_status - Special educational needs (SEN) status
No special educational need 
SEN with a statement or education, health and care plan

Deprived_schools - Deprived schools status
Most deprived - The 10 per cent of schools with the highest proportion of all pupils at the school who are disadvantaged (eligible for FSM in any Spring Autumn, Summer, Alternative Provision or Pupil Referral Unit census from Year 6 to Year 11 or are looked after children).
Least deprived - The 10 per cent of schools with the lowest proportion of all pupils at the school who are disadvantaged (eligible for FSM in any Spring Autumn, Summer, Alternative Provision or Pupil Referral Unit census from Year 6 to Year 11 or are looked after children).	

Methodology
The percentage of pupils achieving each indicator is calculated by taking the number of pupils achieving that particular indicator divided by the relevant denominator and multiplying by 100.
For example, to calculate the percentage of White girls achieving 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE or equivalent, the calculation would be as follows:

KS4_LEVEL2_girls_white_15 / NATden_girls_white_15 * 100
